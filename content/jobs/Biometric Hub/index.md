- Designed BioB, a system-on-chip prototype for secure Aadhaar authentication using cryptographic trust initialization without central authority
- Developed and simulated biometric processing pipelines using deep convolutional neural networks to model user behavior and validate secure offline authentication
- Produced comprehensive cross-domain simulations to determine how my miniature machine-learning models and ultra-sampling algorithms embedded in the BioB SoC would securely communicate over the Aadhaar protocols. Targeted the SoC design and test chips to UMC 28nm node.
